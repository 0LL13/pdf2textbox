pdf2textbox
============

A PDF-to-text converter based on pdfminer2 (which is based on 
pdfminer.six which is based on pdfminer).
Converts PDF files with up to 3 columns to text and avoids the 
caveats that multi-columned PDF files have in store for PDF 
conversion.


Features
--------

Convert PDF to text in the original order. This works well for PDF-files
without tables, graphs, and other stuff.

Note:
The textboxes will rarely be identical with paragraphs of the 
PDF-file.
There might be cases when a textbox ends mid-sentence just to be
coninued with the next box. This is due to the PDF file's graphic-
oriented organization of content. However, the order of text will
be correct.

When a document contains tables and other stuff, there is still a good
chance to get hold of the text in a meaningful order, however the task
to strip and reconnect the boxes will become tedious.

Installation
------------

pip install pdf2textbox
