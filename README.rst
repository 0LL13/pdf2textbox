============
pdf2textbox
============

A PDF-to-text converter based on pdfminer2 (which is based on 
pdfminer.six which is based on pdfminer).
Converts PDF files with up to 3 columns and a header (optional)
to text and avoids most caveats that multi-columned PDF files have 
in store for PDF conversion.


Features
--------

Convert PDF to text in the original order. This works well for PDF-files
without tables, graphs, and other stuff.

Allows command line parameter -s (--slice) to indicate that only part of 
the PDF document is of interest. Start and end page will then be either 
retreived from the document's name using '_' or '|' as delimiters or - 
if start and end page cannot be found - user input is requested.


Installation
------------

    pip install pdf2textbox
